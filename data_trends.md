1. Income and Bike Purchases

Customers with higher income are more likely to purchase a bike.

Males tend to have higher average income and a higher purchase rate compared to females.

Customers with an income above $55,000 are significantly more inclined to buy a bike.

2. Age Brackets and Purchasing Behavior

The majority of bike purchases occur in the 31-54 age group.

Younger customers (0-30) and older customers (55+) buy fewer bikes, suggesting that middle-aged individuals are the primary market.

This might be due to lifestyle choices, fitness considerations, or commuting needs.

3. Commute Distance and Bike Sales

Customers who commute shorter distances (0-5 miles) are more likely to buy a bike.

For distances over 10 miles, the likelihood of bike purchases drops significantly.

This indicates that bikes are mostly used for shorter commutes, likely replacing cars or public transport.

4. Education and Bike Purchases

Customers with a higher level of education (Graduate Degree, Bachelors) tend to purchase bikes more frequently.

Those with only Partial High School education show lower purchasing rates, potentially indicating financial or lifestyle factors.
